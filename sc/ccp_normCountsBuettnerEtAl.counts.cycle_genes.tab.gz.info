    "description": "A single-cell RNA-seq dataset comprised of 182 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with known cell-cycle phase. Cells were sorted using FACS for three different cell-cycle phases. This resulted in a filtered set of 59 cells in G1 phase, 58 cells in S phase and 65 cells in G2M phase. Next, single-cell RNA-seq was performed using the C1 Single Cell Auto Prep System (Fluidigm). The raw read counts were normalised using two different size factors derived from endogenous genes and ERCC spike-ins.  The reduced data set contains expression of 563 genes related to cell cycle based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms.",
