    "description": "The mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were FACS sorted into G1, S and G2M phases.  A total of 35 cells (seven S, eight G2M and 20 G1 cells) were sequenced using the Quartz-seq protocol and gene expression was normalised to FPKM values. The amount of technical noise expected for genes with variable levels of expression was estimated using a log-linear fit between the expression mean and the squared coefficient of variation between cells. The complete dataset contains expression of 36,807 genes.",
