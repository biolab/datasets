Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a common blood disease caused by a chromosomal translocation creating a chimeric tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL) that is permanently active and causes uncontrolled proliferation of blood progenitor cells. CML crises can be very effectively treated by using drugs called Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI), but TKI resistance appears in some patients that prompted the development of new generation TKIs. However, the T315I mutation renders BCR-ABL kinases resistant to all generations of TKI (resistance to imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib). The dataset is from the Sandt et al. (2018) study where murine embryonic stem cells were used to evaluate the T315I mutation in a stem cell context, mimicking the blood progenitor context. The question was whether we could separate the cells expressing the mutated BCR-ABL from the cells expressing the wild type BCR-ABL. Murine embryonic GS2 cells (mES GS2) were transduced either with MIGR, MIGR-BCR-ABL or MIGR-T315I vectors and grown on low-e slides. The dataset contains spectra of individual mES GS2 cells measured by synchrotron radiation FTIR microspectroscopy in transflection mode at 12x12 \u00b5m\u00b2 spatial resolution. Data was collected and compiled by Dr. Christophe Sandt.",

They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with very little differences. The diseases in this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, chronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases share many histopathological features as well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that a disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning stage and may have the characteristic features at the following stages. Patients were first evaluated clinically with 12 features. Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22 histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope. In the dataset constructed for this domain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was given a degree in the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the feature was not present, 3 indicates the largest amount possible, and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate values.",

Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuaries call this process symboling.

This system consists of a phased array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts. The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere. 'Good' radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere. 'Bad' returns are those that do not; their signals pass through the ionosphere. Received signals were processed using an autocorrelation function whose arguments are the time of a pulse and the pulse number. There were 17 pulse numbers for the Goose Bay system. Instances in this database are described by 2 attributes per pulse number, corresponding to the complex values returned by the function resulting from the complex electromagnetic signal.",
