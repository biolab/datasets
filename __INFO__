Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a common blood disease caused by a chromosomal translocation creating a chimeric tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL) that is permanently active and causes uncontrolled proliferation of blood progenitor cells. CML crises can be very effectively treated by using drugs called Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI), but TKI resistance appears in some patients that prompted the development of new generation TKIs. However, the T315I mutation renders BCR-ABL kinases resistant to all generations of TKI (resistance to imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib). The dataset is from the Sandt et al. (2018) study where murine embryonic stem cells were used to evaluate the T315I mutation in a stem cell context, mimicking the blood progenitor context. The question was whether we could separate the cells expressing the mutated BCR-ABL from the cells expressing the wild type BCR-ABL. Murine embryonic GS2 cells (mES GS2) were transduced either with MIGR, MIGR-BCR-ABL or MIGR-T315I vectors and grown on low-e slides. The dataset contains spectra of individual mES GS2 cells measured by synchrotron radiation FTIR microspectroscopy in transflection mode at 12x12 \u00b5m\u00b2 spatial resolution. Data was collected and compiled by Dr. Christophe Sandt.",

All attributes were discrete, having from three to four values. The data set provides car's utility for all possible combinations of attribute values. The data set was originally created to showcase the ability of machine learning by function decomposition to recreate the hierarchy of the decision model.",

They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with very little differences. The diseases in this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, chronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases share many histopathological features as well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that a disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning stage and may have the characteristic features at the following stages. Patients were first evaluated clinically with 12 features. Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22 histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope. In the dataset constructed for this domain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was given a degree in the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the feature was not present, 3 indicates the largest amount possible, and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate values.",
